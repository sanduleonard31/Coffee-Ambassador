  "Description":"I traveled to the Milan Reserve Roastery for a focused training session with the 2024 EMEA Champion. We worked on latte art, extraction, and consistency, rotated through high-volume bar stations, and compared simple best practices with an international team. I also deepened manual espresso, V60 and siphon profiles, and saw Reserve workflows end-to-end (roasting, packaging, Arriviamo) in real service conditions - practical, direct, and immediately usable.\n\nBack home, I turned that momentum into action. I launched latte art workshops for partners, built a structured training plan for district winners, and invested more in sharing knowledge. The plan uses clear modules (milk texture, pours, patterns, station setup, service under pressure). The aim is confident, consistent performance and a stronger learning culture across the team.",
