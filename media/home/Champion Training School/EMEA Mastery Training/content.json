  "Description":"I trained Gabriel Dobre for the EMEA Barista Championship by focusing on four key areas: Signature Beverage (Canolli Latte), Coffee Storytelling (using Cafe Verona), Technical Skills, and Competition Readiness. For the signature drink, we developed a Canolli Latte using Blonde Espresso with Italian-inspired narrative and market research to support its relevance. The coffee storytelling training emphasized presenting Cafe Verona with an Emotional Caregiver approach, while technical skills focused on executing three distinct latte art patterns while maintaining efficiency. Mental preparation strategies ensured Gabriel could handle pressure situations and blind tastings with confidence.",
