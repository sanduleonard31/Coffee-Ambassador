  "Description":"I asked each District Champion the same set of questions and created a dedicated Teams post for every one of them, so we could celebrate and showcase their stories—even if they didn’t win nationals. These spotlights let our values shine through them and demonstrate how attention, recognition, and genuine care can motivate, connect, and build a sense of belonging.\n\nWhat I asked and why:\n- Role and tenure: to anchor their journey and provide context.\n- Favorite coffee and why: to make craft expertise tangible and relatable.\n- How their passion started: to highlight curiosity and a growth mindset.\n- Barista Championship takeaways: to frame the competition as learning, not rivalry.\n- How they inspire partners: to surface peer leadership and knowledge-sharing.\n- A memorable customer interaction: to show real impact and service moments.\n- What they value in the Starbucks community: to connect personal values to culture.\n- What’s next/what they’re focusing on now: to reinforce continuous development and belonging.\n\nWhy this format:\n- Consistency ensured fairness and made stories easier to compare and celebrate.\n- The repeated structure amplified our values through many authentic voices.\n- Dedicated posts gave attention and recognition to every champion.",
