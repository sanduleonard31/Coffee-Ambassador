  "Description":"I created the Coffee Masters national group chat after careful data centralization from all store managers about which Coffee Masters they have in their teams. The group chat now serves as the main communication and announcement channel for Coffee Masters only, to deepen our connection, uplift responsibility, and better understand how the role can impact the whole team. We now manage them by having a District Coffee Master Leader responsible for diverse activities related to Coffee Masters.",
